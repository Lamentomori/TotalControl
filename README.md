## 🧩 Contribution

Pull requests. Feedback. Ideas.  
**All are welcome.** Let’s build the future of home-grade NDR together.

> 🛡️ Security isn’t a product - it’s a mindset.

## ⚠️ Acceptance of Liability

**TotalControl** is a _notification and visibility tool_ - not an antivirus or active defense system.  
Its primary function is to **log** and **alert** users when network behaviour deviates from the norm.

> It does **not** guarantee protection from threats - it simply ensures you're aware when you're at risk.
